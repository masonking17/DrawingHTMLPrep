        Data-Driven Documents, best known as D3, is a Javascript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations in web browsers. Embedded within an HTML webpage, the D3 library uses pre-built JavaScript functions to select elements, create SVG objects, style them, or add transitions as well as dynamic effects to them.

        There are a few essential parts to the J3 library, including the select, append, text, and style commands.
    </p>
<br>
    <ul> 
        <li> The select command will refer to a CSS selector as the input and will returm a reference to the first element in the DOM that matches</li>
        <li> The append command creates whatever the new DOM element you specify and appends it to the end of whatevevr selection it's acting on.</li>
        <li> The text command takes a string and inserts it between the opening and closing tags of the current selection</li>
        <li> The style command allows the user to set HTML attributes and CSS properties on selections. This is likely the most important command in the J3 library</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    J3 is important in altering the visual of a data set and creating a better webpage
